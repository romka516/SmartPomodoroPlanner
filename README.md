# Automated Study Planner using Pomodoro Technique

This project aims to provide an automated study planner based on the Pomodoro technique, while also keeping track of study time for different subjects. It utilizes automatic data visualization tools such as tables and graphs to present the study information effectively.

## Features
- Automatic study plan generation based on the Pomodoro technique
- Recording and tracking study time for each subject
- Visualization of study progress through tables and graphs
- Flexibility to study without following the Pomodoro technique
- Easy input of start and end times for study sessions
- Handling of breaks between study intervals and sessions

## Spreadsheet Structure

The study planner utilizes a spreadsheet with the following column names:

1.	DATE: Date of the study session
2.	STARTING TIME: Start time of the session
3.	ENDING TIME: End time of the session
4.	DURATION: Duration of the session
5.	COURSE: Subject or course being studied
6.	RESULT: Outcome of the study session (+ for completed, - for incomplete)

## Pomodoro Technique

In the Pomodoro technique, each study session consists of 4 intervals, with each interval being 25 minutes long. The breaks between intervals are as follows:

- 5-minute break between the first three intervals
- 7-minute break between the third and fourth intervals

If the user wishes to have multiple study sessions, a 15-minute break is provided between sessions. However, if the user prefers to study without following the Pomodoro technique, they can still use the automated study planner.

## Usage

To use the automated study planner with the Pomodoro technique, follow these steps:

1. Enter the desired starting time and the number of study sessions in the program.
2. The program will automatically fill in the date, break times between intervals, and break times between sessions.
3. Fill in the RESULT column with "+" for successfully completed sessions and "-" for incomplete sessions.
